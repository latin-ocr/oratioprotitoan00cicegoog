peoplc at a meeting, arging them to be present in large numbers
on the following day, and not suffer Milo to get off, but ntalre their
own werdict on the case and their sympathy for Clodius apparent
to the judges when proceeding ιο the vote. Next day, which sas
the eleventh of April [l the eighth; §i ι, 98], the shops were closed

throughout the eity3 Pompeius stationed guarda in the Forum and

, its approaches, and toolr his seat himself, as he had done the day

before, in frent of the Treasury, with a body-guard of picked men.
The choiee of the judges by lot then took place very carly in the
day, after which as great a stillness prevailed throughout the Forum
as was possible in any Forum under such circumstances. lleforc
eight o’cloclr in the morning, the elder Appius, Marcus Antonius
and P. Valerius Nepos, commenced speaking for the prosecution,
and consumed the two hours allowed them by the law. 'l'he reply
on the part of the defendant was made ογ Cicero alone. Some per·
sons were of opinion that the line of defence proper tobetalren in the
present instance was, that in killing Clodius Milo had proved himself
abenefactor to the commonwealth ; and this was the line actually
adopted by M. Brutus in a defence of Milo which he wrote and
published, as though it had been really delivered Cicero, however,
did not taire this view, because though it might be for the public
interest that a man should be condemned to death, it did not follow
that for the sarm reason he might he killed unconrlemned As
therefore the accusers had proeeeded on the ground that Clodius
was waylaid by Milo, (which was false, the quarrel having acci·
dentally ariaco.) Cicero, taking advantage of their untenable posi·
tion, undertoolr to prove tltat Mile, on the contrary, had been
waylaid by Clodius3 and this is tlte gist of his whole speech.
'l'hat point, however, being as incapahle of proof as the other,·it
then beearrw evident, as l have said, that neither party had any
intention of fighting on that day, but that the encounter was a
casual one, the squabble between the slaves having led eventu·
ally to the bloodsbed which ensued. lt was, nevertbeless, quite
notorious that each oi them had frequently threatened the life of
the others and while the largeness of his retinue was a suspicious
circumstance in Milo’s case, the followers of Clodius, on the mhcr

’ hand, were in better trim for fighting. lls Cicero was οιςίοοίος
